###Students Details Form###

Creating a complete Google Form using only HTML is not possible, as Google Forms are more complex and require server-side processing to collect and store responses. However, you can create a form with HTML that mimics the appearance of a simple form. The data won't be submitted to a Google Form, but you can customize the HTML form to handle the input data as per your requirements.

 HTML code creates a simple student information form with fields for name, email, age, gender, course selection, and comments. It includes basic input validation using the required attribute. However, as mentioned earlier, this is just a static HTML form. To collect and process responses, you'd need server-side scripting (e.g., PHP, Python, etc.) and a database to store the data.

For a fully functional form that behaves like a Google Form, you need to use Google Forms directly or a form-building service that allows integration with Google Sheets or other databases.
